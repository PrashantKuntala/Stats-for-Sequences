Markov.c implements the markov model to calculate the O/E scores for the books.
Works for models 1,2,3 and above.

The program is fast and expected time to finish execution is 20sec

The stationary distribution is assumed to be phi(w) = p(w)
so for Example , for model = 2 and word = " THE ", we have :

phi(T) * N(TH)/N(T) * N(HE)/N(H)

for model = 3 we have

phi(TH) * N(THE)/N(TH)
here we assume,  phi(TH) = p(T)*p(H)

four books were used for the output and Ecoli.fasta file that is the ecoli genome.

books used :
alice in wonderland
einstein's theory of relativity
California mexican spanish cookbook
woordcarving

All the data files are in the data.tar.gz file.

The output files are included as a csv files.

compiling :

gcc Markov.c

executing:

./a.out -min 2 -max 8 -desctot -order 2 ./full_texts_whitesp_nonchars_removed/alice_in_wonderland_nows > outputfile.tsv
