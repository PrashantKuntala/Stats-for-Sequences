Markov.c implements the markov model to calculate the O/E scores for the books.
Works for models 1,2,3 and above.

The program is fast and expected time to finish execution is nearly 20sec

The stationary distribution is assumed to be phi(w) = p(w)
so for Example , for model = 2 and word = " THE ", we have :

phi(T) * N(TH)/N(T) * N(HE)/N(H)

for model = 3 we have

phi(TH) * N(THE)/N(TH)
here we assume,  phi(TH) = p(T)*p(H)

two books were used for the output.

books used :
alice in wonderland
einstein's theory of relativity



compiling :
-----------
gcc Markov.c

executing:
----------
./a.out -min 3 -max 5 -desctot -order 2 ./books/alice_in_wonderland_nows ./books/einstein_relativity_nows  > outfile.tsv
